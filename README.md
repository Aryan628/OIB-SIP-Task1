# Password Generator

## Overview

This Python script is a simple password generator that allows users to customize the length and character types of generated passwords. The script prompts users for their preferences, including password length and whether to include letters, numbers, and symbols. It then generates a random password based on the specified criteria.

## Features

- Customizable password length.
- Choice of including letters, numbers, and symbols in the generated password.
- Visual indication of the password generation process.
- Cross-platform screen clearing for a cleaner output.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python Password_Generator.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to specify the desired password length and character types.

3. The script will generate a random password and display it on the console.

4. If you wish to generate another password, enter 'y' when prompted. To exit the program, enter any other character.

## Dependencies

This script uses the following Python modules:

- `os`: For system-specific functionalities (screen clearing).
- `string`: Provides constants for ASCII letters and punctuation.
- `random`: Used for generating random numbers.
- `time`: Used for simulating processing time in the loading animation.

## Notes
